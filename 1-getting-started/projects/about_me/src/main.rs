// TODO: Complete the following exercises:
// 1. Create a new `about_me` project with the `cargo new` command.
// 2. Using the `println!` macro, output 3 sentences about yourself. Feel free to invoke the macro multiple times.
// 3. From the Terminal, compile the `main.rs` file inside the `src` folder with the Rust compiler, then manually run the executable.
// 4. From the Terminal, compile the project with the Cargo tool, then manually run the executable.
// 5. From the Terminal, compile and run the project with a single Cargo command.
// 6. Check your program for errors with `cargo check`.
// 7. Add a comment at the top of your source code explaining how to compile the program for new Rust developers.
// 8. Add some spaces and line breaks to the code so that it is formatted in an ugly manner. From the Terminal, style the code with the `cargo fmt` command.
// 9. Replace the `println!` macro with `print!`. What happens?

    // To compile this program:
    // 1. Make sure you have Rust installed (https://rustup.rs)
    // 2. Open a terminal in this directory
    // 3. Run `cargo build` to compile
    // 4. Run `cargo run` to compile and run in one step
    // 5. Or use `rustc src/main.rs` to compile directly with the Rust compiler
